# Diabetic-Health-indicator
1.Problem Definition: 
Task Definition 
The task at hand is to develop a machine learning model to classify individuals' diabetes status based 
on various health indicators. The three possible outcomes are: 
▪ Class 0: No diabetes. 
▪ Class 1: Pre-diabetes. 
▪ Class 2: Diabetes. 
The dataset used for this task is the BRFSS 2015 diabetes dataset, containing health metrics such as 
BMI, age, physical activity, and other medical conditions. 
Motivation 
Diabetes is a major health concern worldwide, and early detection can significantly reduce long-term 
complications. By developing a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes, this 
project aims to provide an automated tool for diabetes risk assessment. 
This project is motivated by the following factors: 
• Global Health Impact: Diabetes prevalence is increasing, making timely detection tools more 
essential than ever. 
• Automation and Scalability: By leveraging machine learning, healthcare professionals can 
obtain faster, more reliable diabetes risk assessments compared to traditional methods. 
• Data-Driven Insights: The model will not only classify diabetes risk but also highlight the 
most influential health factors contributing to diabetes, providing actionable insights for 
individuals and healthcare practitioners. 
Objective 
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify an 
individual’s diabetes status using the provided health indicators. The model’s performance will be 
evaluated using accuracy as the main metric. 
2.Dataset Details 
The dataset includes 253,680 entries and 22 columns, including the target column, Diabetes 012, 
which represents the diabetes classification (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for pre-diabetic, and 2 for diabetic). 
Here is an overview of the features:  
▪ Features related to health conditions: HighBP, HighChol, Stroke, HeartDiseaseorAttack  
▪ Lifestyle-related indicators: PhysActivity, Smoker, HvyAlcoholConsump, Fruits, Veggies  
▪ Healthcare access and health status indicators: AnyHealthcare, NoDocbcCost, GenHlth, 
MentHlth, PhysHlth, DiffWalk  
▪ Demographics: Sex, Age, Education, Income  
▪ Target: Diabetes 012 (three classes for diabetes status (0: No diabetes, 1: Prediabetes, 2: 
Diabetes))
